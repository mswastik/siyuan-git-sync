# SiYuan Git Sync Plugin Implementation - COMPLETE

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## Overview
This document confirms the successful completion of the SiYuan Git Sync Plugin enhancement project. The implementation includes improved folder structure handling and comprehensive file deletion synchronization.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Enhanced Folder Structure Implementation ✅
**Issue Resolved**: Incorrect `notebooks` folder generation during full sync operations
- Modified `pullFromGitHubInternal()` method to properly handle folder paths
- Implemented clear separation of file types:
  - Notebooks in `notebooks/` directory
  - Config files in `config/` directory
  - Plugins in `plugins/` directory
  - Templates in `templates/` directory
- Verified correct mapping between GitHub repository and local SiYuan file system

### 2. File Deletion Synchronization ✅
**New Feature Added**: Bidirectional file deletion sync
- Implemented `deleteFileFromGitHub()` method for remote file deletion
- Implemented `deleteLocalFile()` method for local file deletion
- Enhanced both push and pull operations to handle file deletions
- Added comprehensive deletion support for all file types

### 3. Code Quality & Robustness ✅
- Refactored core synchronization methods for improved reliability
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the plugin
- Added proper safeguards to prevent accidental data loss
- Implemented detailed progress reporting for all operations

### 4. Documentation Updates ✅
- Updated `README.md` with new features and usage instructions
- Modified `quickstart-guide.md` with accurate setup instructions
- Created comprehensive `CHANGELOG.md` documenting all changes
- Added technical implementation summaries

### 5. Build & Packaging ✅
- Successfully compiled plugin using Vite build system
- Generated distribution package (`siyuan-git-sync-v1.0.0.zip`)
- Verified all necessary files included in distribution
- Confirmed version numbers updated to 1.0.0
